\usage{
ReadCount2FPKM(
  readcount,
  geneid = "ensembl",
  genomic = c("hg38", "hg38_biomart", "hg19")[1]
)
}
\arguments{
\item{readcount}{Read count matrix(row is gene, column is sample)}

\item{geneid}{Only support \code{ensembl} now}

\item{genomic}{Only support \code{hg38}, \code{hg19}, or \code{hg38_biomart} now}
}
\value{
FPKM-like expression matrix
}
\description{
RNA-Seq Read Count to FPKM RNA-Seq Read Count to FPKM-like Gene length-normalized expression matrix
}
\details{
FPKM-like expression = Read Count × 10^9 / (Gene Length(bp) × Total Read Count)
